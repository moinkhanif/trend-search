## About the project

This project is the Capstone Solo project for the Ruby section of the Microverse curriculum. It utilizes various helpful gems like Nokogiri, geocoder ,and easy-translate to scrap [Google Trends XML page](https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/daily/rss?geo=US) for the latest trends for a given country.

- Make sure to run `bundle` command in the terminal once you are in the working directory
- You'll also have to set up google API key if you need the translation feature as mentioned [below](#utilizing-the-translation-feature)
You should be good to go after verifying the above details ðŸ˜„

- Ability to change Country and Information limit

- Resetting values to default

- Translation of other languages to English if any (Requires Google Cloud API Key)

- Suggesting locations and prompting user based on country change input

## Technologies Used

- This project utilizes the Ruby programming language

- Ruby Gems:

  - gem 'geocoder'
  - gem 'nokogiri'
  - gem 'rest-client'
  - gem 'os'
  - gem 'easy_translate'
  - gem 'dotenv'

## Utilizing the translation feature

To be able to use the translation feature on one's system, you'll have to do the following:

- Place the key iside `.env_sample` file
- Rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env`

## Outputs

On the first run, the program produces the following output:

```ruby
$ ruby bin/main.rb

"Please choose your option:"
"1. Show Daily Trends from  United States"
"2. Show Trends from a different country"
"3. Change Number of Trends to Show"
"4. Reset country and number of trend"
"5 or 'q' to Quit"
```

On requesting a change in the country, the output is as follows:

```ruby
2
"Please enter the country name"
Jeju
"Did you mean South Korea? (y/n)"
```

Once the program gets a confirmation, the program proceeds as:

```ruby
"Country changed to South Korea!"


"Please choose your option:"
"1. Show Daily Trends from  South Korea"
"2. Show Trends from a different country"
"3. Change Number of Trends to Show"
"4. Reset country and number of trend"
"5 or 'q' to Quit"
```
